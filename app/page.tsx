                Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born
                as a nonsense text. “It is not Latin, though it looks like it,
                and it actually says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered
                a curious reader, “Its words loosely approximate the frequency
                with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it
                looks pretty real.”

                The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor
                sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because
                in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.

                Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from Hampden-Sydney College,
                is credited with discovering the source behind the ubiquitous
                filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest was
                piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word.
                Consulting a Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from
                De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and
                Evil”), a first-century B.C. text from the Roman philosopher
                Cicero.

            <p>
                In particular, the garbled words of lorem ipsum bear an
                unmistakable resemblance to sections 1.10.32–33 of Cicero&apos;s
                work, with the most notable passage excerpted below:
            </p>

            <p>
                “Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit
                amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius
                modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat
                voluptatem.”
            </p>

            <h3>A 1914 English translation by Harris Rackham reads:</h3>

            <p>
                “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
                pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally
                circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
                great pleasure.”
            </p>

            <p>
                McClintock&apos;s eye for detail certainly helped narrow the
                whereabouts of lorem ipsum&apos;s origin, however, the “how and
                when” still remain something of a mystery, with competing
                theories and timelines.

            <h2>Remixing a classic</h2>

            <p>
                So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According
                to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part
                of Cicero&apos;s De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text
                to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.
            </p>

            <p>
                It&apos;s difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use
                before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s,
                although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem
                ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples. So far he
                hasn&apos;t relocated where he once saw the passage, but the
                popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory
                that the filler text has been used for centuries.
